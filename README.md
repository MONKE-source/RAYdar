## What this is for

For the hackathon we had to create a product for solving inequalities. For this we created a chrome extension that utilises machine learning to detect what messages are offensive for people in the LGBTQ+ group and which messages were racist

the features are 

- when enabled it will scan whatever is typed and send an alert if the message is offensive
- can paste in whatever text to see how offensive it is on a scale of 1 - 100
